Hide with your candles in the darkness terrified of attackers trying to extinguish them.

## Preparation

Buy a lot of *tealights*. [IKEA's Glimma](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/decoration/candles-candle-holders/glimma-unscented-tealight-art-50097995/) cost 2-3 cents per piece. We got 200 of them but ended up needing around a hundred.

Prepare a few simple tasks for a number of posts equal to the number of teams playing. You can take the [tasks we used](tasks.md).

Designate the ending location (we opted out for the main square).

Play after the sundown.

## Start

Send coordinators to pre-chosen outdoor locations. They should be ideally all 5-12 minute walk from each other.

The coordinator without an assigned post (let's call them the *game master*) takes all the players outdoor and explains the core rules. The players are told approximate directions of all the posts. The *game master* provides a lit *tealight* for each team and starts the game.

## Core Rules

Each team gets a candle. For the first 20 minutes of the game players cannot attack each other. After that period feel free to blow out an opponents candle. Don't physically attack the opponent, though.

Players can move freely through the playing area.

15 minutes before the end of the game the ending location becomes a no-attack and no-lighting zone. Players can no longer extinguish each other *tealights*, but they can also no longer light them from each other. If they want to, they have to leave the ending location.

At the end of the game count all the lit *tealights* at the ending location. Each team gets points equal to the number of lit *tealights*.

### During the game, don't

- leave a lit *tealight* unattended
- lit a *tealight* by anything other than another *tealight* (no lighters, flint and steel or help from non-players)
- don't light a *tealight* from the candles on the cemetery
- don't attack a team at a post
- be nice to each other

### During the game, feel free to

- extinguish opponent's *tealight* when outside of the forbidden zones and time periods
- light a *tealight* from another *tealight* either your own or another player
- give a *tealight* to someone else
- form alliances
- split the team

## Coordinator Rules

When a team visits your location, give them a task. If they accomplish it give them a *tealight*. Each team can complete each task only once.

During our playthrough (with teams of 6-7 players) we decided that at least 4 members of the team must be present when accomplishing tasks. This regulated the number of players able to hide somewhere with the *tealights* or attacking other teams. If we played this again we would maybe lift this condition.

## Game Master Rules

*Game master* walks around the area and checks wether everything is going smoothly. During the first minutes of the game (it was around 15 during our playthrough) the game master should relit the *tealights* for free. Adjust this accoarding to weather and player skills.

After that period start to charge players unlit *tealights* for lighting other ones. The price should go up and the players should be aware of that (so keep convincing them to do the deal, but don't force them). In the end of the game we asked for 4 unlit candles for lighting the fifth one.

## Notes

When we played the game in November 2017, there were 4 teams and they managed to score between 5 and 17 points. It rained lightly and the players managed to find all kinds of containers around the playing area to protect their tealights. Many of those came from various trash bins.

The game took 2.5 hours including the rules explanation.
