# Triggers
[free-for-all][scorable][camp-long]

A camp-long game where each player is assigned a trigger and a reaction. They perform their reactions on their triggers and try to guess each others triggers and reactions.

## Preparation

Prepare a trigger and reaction for each player. Print these combinations out and track them in a spreadsheet.

Example triggers and reactions:

- When someone sings, you dance
- When someone says a number, you announce whether it is prime
- When you cross paths with someone, you yield to them

You can have multiple players with the same triggers and reactions (the yielding ones are fun) and you can also chain the players by letting someone reaction be someone else's action. You can even have cycles, if they are large enough players should be able to escape and break them.

## Start

Each player is given a piece of paper with a trigger and a reaction. Warn the players to keep the content of their papers hidden. Explain the rules.

## Rules

Whenever (during the whole camp) a player witnesses the trigger they were given, they have to respond with their assigned reaction. Players should try to find out other players' triggers and reactions and report them to the game master.

Players should not worry about having their trigger and reaction uncovered â€” there's almost no disadvantage, so please don't try to hide your reactions.

## Scoring

Players are awarded a point for guessing each correct trigger + reaction combination of another player. A combination can be submitted by multiple players.

## Remarks

Out of 32 players only 7 reported any trigger/reaction to the game master. Those seven scored: 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, 1 and 1 point.

Perhaps we could have chosen better triggers. Next time we would (as organisers) maybe try to trigger them intentionally as well.
