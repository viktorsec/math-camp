# Inner Names
[team][scorable][outdoor]

A game heavily inspired by Vlaada Chvátil's fantastic [Codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames).

## Preparation

You need

- at least one more coordinator than the number of teams
- printed word boards
- printed word lists assigned to teams
- few blank notes and something to write

Let's say you have *n* teams with *k* to *k+1* members. Generate a list of *n* \* *k* random non-repeating words. They shouldn't be too obscure. In case you want to play several rounds, do this for every round.

Print the sheets *n* times in large letters, preferably on glossy/durable paper. We will call these *word boards*.

Shuffle the words randomly into *n* sets of *k*, mark each set with a team number and print each set *n* times (printing *n^2* sets overall). We will call these *word lists*.

Assign one coordinator per team and give them

- a copy of the rules
- one full word board
- a complete set of word lists
- a blank note for their team, let's call it *the licence* (you can write the team name on the top)

## Start

Send coordinators to chosen outdoor locations. They should be ideally all 5-12 minute walk from each other.

The coordinator without an assigned team (let's call them *the moderator*) takes all the players to some place and lets each team know of the location of their coordinator. The teams are expected to go visit them.

When a team finds their coordinator, the coordinator explains the rules (bellow) to them. The team chooses one of them — let's call them *the Revealer*. The Revealer stays with the coordinator until the end of the round. The rest of the team is issued the licence.

There is no reason to revisit the teams original location until the end of the round. If they do, they should be told to leave.

When a team visits foreign location without a licence, they should be sent to their original location. When a team visits a foreign location, they have a licence but the Revealer on the location is not ready yet, tell them to either wait or go visit another location in the meantime.

## Core rules
(You can read this to the original team on their first visit.)

You all have your true inner names and they are hidden in this table (show them the word board). There are *n-1* Revealers out there, who can help you find them out.

When you meet a Revealer, they give you a hint. Be patient, it might take them a bit and it is beneficent for both you and them for the hint to be as good as possible.

The Revealer gives you the hint and a number indicating how many of you are connected to said hint. You can then brainstorm and as a team guess which names could belong to you. It doesn't matter which name belongs to which person in the team.

You can take a maximum of *number_stated_by_the_Revealer + 1* guesses (in order). Be careful, when you guess a word that's not yours you **loose 1 point** and you have to leave and find another Revealer.

For correctly guessed names (during one visit of a Revealer) you get awarded points accoarding to the following formula.

sum(1->j); j = number of names

You may tell the Revealer the names you already know, but you cannot advice them on the form of the hint, including the number.

You can exchange information with other teams. You may visit a Revealer again only when you visited all the other revealers (number of teams - 2) since your last visit.

Now choose one of you and leave them here (on the original location). This person will be responsible for approximately half of your score.

## Revealer Rules
(Tell these to the Revealer after their team leaves the original location. You can hand over the word lists to the Revealer now, they are forbidden to show them to anyone.)

The Revealer is forbidden to talk while there are any players at the location, aside from giving the hint. The Revealer cannot make any other sounds or gestures at any time. The hint consists of a clue and number indicating the number of team members connected to the clue.

The clue has to
- be one word
- be in english / another chosen language
- a real dictionary word

The clue cannot be
- a word from the word board
- a word etymologically closely related to a word from the word board

The Revealer gets the same amount of points as the teams at their location.

Any rule breaking (even involuntary) results in a **loss of 4 points** for the Revealer.

## Coordinator Rules

When a team visits your location, sign their license and mark the words they managed to guess and, if applicable, the word they guessed wrong.

Pay attention to stop all players from breaking the rules. When you don't understand what the Revealer meant by their hint, but the hint does not break stated rules, it is alright.

When some team guesses all their names, send them back to start.

When a team returns to start and knows all their names, write down the time they did that. Teams at the start can play Contact, Ninjas or some other game.

The coordinator at start decides when to stop the proceeding round and recall all players to start. You can call to all the coordinators, who tell their Revealers, who tell their teams. The next round starts similar to the first one, but there are some differences.

- all locations replace their word boards for new ones
- the teams are assigned new origin locations
- the teams are asked to choose new Revealers

When we played the game in April 2017, there were 5 teams and we decided to start the second round after the third team managed to complete the first turn. The second turn was cut when we run out of time, with three teams managing to finish again.

The game took 2.5 hours including explaining the rules.
